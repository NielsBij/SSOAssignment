# SSOAssignment

This was my attempt at making a SSO app.
I used ASP.NET as a framework since I was familiar with it, but I previously always worked in an already set up environment.
I wasted a lot of time getting set up because of my inexperience with building things up.
oAuth went well once I had set my project up properly.
I did not manage to get the SSO between fully seperate apps working so they ended up as 2 webpages under the same initial address.

To run it you would need to open the project in for example visual studio, build it and run it in a browser.
